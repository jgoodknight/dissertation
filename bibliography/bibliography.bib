abstract = {We present two-dimensional Fourier transform optical spectroscopy measurements of two types of molecular J-aggregate thin films and show that temperature-dependent dynamical effects govern exciton delocalization at all temperatures, even in the presence of significant inhomogeneity. Our results indicate that in the tested molecular aggregates, even when the static structure disorder dominates exciton dephasing dynamics, the extent of exciton delocalization may be limited by dynamical fluctuations, mainly exciton-phonon coupling. Thus inhomogeneous dephasing may mediate the exciton coherence time whereas dynamical fluctuations mediate the exciton coherence length.},

Here, we develop such a paradigm and present a model photocell based on the nanoscale architecture and molecular elements of photosynthetic reaction centers. Quantum interference of photon absorption and emission induced by the dipole-dipole interaction between molecular excited states guarantees an enhanced light-to-current conversion and power generation for a wide range of electronic, thermal, and optical parameters for optimized dipolar geometries. This result opens a promising new route for designing artificial light-harvesting devices inspired by biological photosynthesis and quantum technologies.},

We investigate how two causes of oscillatory signals are intertwined: (i) electronic coherences supporting delocalized wavelike motion and (ii) narrow bands in the vibronic spectral density. To disentangle the vibronic and electronic contributions, we introduce a time-windowed Fourier transform of the signal amplitude. We find that 2D spectra can be dominated by excitations of pathways which are absent in excitonic energy transport. This leads to an underestimation of the lifetime of electronic coherences by 2D spectra.},

It is shown for the simple model of a shifted harmonic oscillator in the Condon approximation that coherent wave packet motion in the excited state is detectable with laser pulses of suitable duration (neither too long nor too short). It is furthermore shown that intramolecular coupling of an optically bright electronic state to a dark state via a single vibrational mode may lead to a pronounced oscillatory electronic population dynamics which can be detected in a pump-probe experiment with sufficiently short pulses. In both cases we analyze the conditions under which the phenomena manifest themselves in the time-resolved pump-probe signal.},

We describe how to construct, calibrate, and operate the device, and we discuss its limitations. We use the exciton states of a semiconductor nanostructure as a working example. A series of complex multidimensional spectra-displayed in amplitude and real parts-reveals increasingly intricate correlations among the excitons.},

@article{QPT2,
abstract = {Is it possible to infer the time evolving quantum state of a multichromophoric system from a sequence of two-dimensional electronic spectra (2D-ES) as a function of waiting time? Here we provide a positive answer for a tractable model system: a coupled dimer. After exhaustively enumerating the Liouville pathways associated to each peak in the 2D-ES, we argue that by judiciously combining the information from a series of experiments varying the polarization and frequency components of the pulses, detailed information at the amplitude level about the input and output quantum states at the waiting time can be obtained. This possibility yields a quantum process tomography (QPT) of the single-exciton manifold, which completely characterizes the open quantum system dynamics through the reconstruction of the process matrix. In this manuscript, we present the general theory as well as specific and numerical results for a homodimer, for which we prove that signals stemming from coherence to population transfer and vice versa vanish upon isotropic averaging, therefore, only allowing for a partial QPT in such case. However, this fact simplifies the spectra, and it follows that only two polarization controlled experiments (and no pulse-shaping requirements) suffice to yield the elements of the process matrix, which survive under isotropic averaging. Redundancies in the 2D-ES amplitudes allow for the angle between the two site transition dipole moments to be self-consistently obtained, hence simultaneously yielding structural and dynamical information of the dimer. Model calculations are presented, as well as an error analysis in terms of the angle between the dipoles and peak amplitude extraction. In the second article accompanying this study, we numerically exemplify the theory for heterodimers and carry out a detailed error analysis for such case. This investigation reveals an exciting quantum information processing (QIP) approach to spectroscopic experiments of excitonic systems, and hence, bridges an important gap between theoretical studies on excitation energy transfer from the QIP standpoint and experimental methods to study such systems in the chemical physics community.},

abstract = {The description of excited state dynamics in energy transfer systems constitutes a theoretical and experimental challenge in modern chemical physics. A spectroscopic protocol that systematically characterizes both coherent and dissipative processes of the probed chromophores is desired. Here, we show that a set of two-color photon-echo experiments performs quantum state tomography (QST) of the one-exciton manifold of a dimer by reconstructing its density matrix in real time. This possibility in turn allows for a complete description of excited state dynamics via quantum process tomography (QPT). Simulations of a noisy QPT experiment for an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of model excitonic dimers show that the protocol distills rich information about dissipative excitonic dynamics, which appears nontrivially hidden in the signal monitored in single realizations of four-wave mixing experiments.},

  abstract={Femtosecond laser spectroscopies are used to investigate the influence of intramolecular nuclear modes on electronic relaxation in the cyanobacterial light harvesting protein, C -phycocyanin (CPC). Of particular interest are sub-ps dynamics localized on pairs of closely spaced phycocyanobilin pigments (i.e. dimers). Experiments conducted under different polarization conditions are used to distinguish isotropic and anisotropic vibrational modes within the dimers. Two isotropic nuclear modes are detected near 185 and 260 cm âˆ’1 using two-dimensional photon echo spectroscopy. In addition, a transient absorption anisotropy measurement reveals vibrational resonances associated with (out-of-plane) anisotropic nuclear modes near 640 and 815 cm âˆ’1 . We investigate two possible origins for the recurrences in the anisotropy. A mechanism involving ground state nuclear coherences in the Condon approximation is ruled out by comparing the potential energy surfaces of the excitons to the direction of wavepacket motion. Electronic structure calculations suggest that non-Condon effects are the most likely explanation for the beats observed in the anisotropy. Such non-Condon effects also hold interesting implications for the vibronic exciton electronic structure of CPC. We calculate non-Condon intermolecular couplings in the dimer as large as 10 cm âˆ’1 , which suggests that these effects are not negligible and deserve further consideration. Our findings provide additional insights into the sub-100 fs vibronic relaxation channel found in the closely related protein, allophycocyanin, whose pigment dimers possess nearly the same geometry and intermolecular Coulombic interactions as CPC. This study underscores the complex interplay of intramolecular vibronic coupling and site energy tuning in photosynthetic light harvesting.}

	abstract = {A quantitative theory for the shapes of the absorption bands of F-centres is given on the basis of the Franck-Condon principle. Underlying the treatment are two simplifying assumptions: namely, (a) that the lattice can be approximately treated as a dielectric continuum; (b) that in obtaining the vibrational wave functions for the lattice, the effect of the F-centre can be considered as that of a static charge distribution. Under these assumptions, it is shown that the absorption constant as a function of frequency and temperature can be expressed in terms of the Bessel functions with imaginary arguments. The theoretical curves for the absorption constant compare very favourably with the experimental curves for all temperatures. Also considered in the paper are the probabilities of non-radiative transitions, which are important in connexion with the photo-conductivity observed following light absorption by F-centres. The treatment given differs from the qualitative considerations hitherto in one important aspect, namely, the strength of the coupling between the electron and the lattice is taken into account. The adiabatic wave functions for the F-centre electron required for the discussion are obtained by perturbation methods. The probability for an excited F-centre to return to its ground state by non-radiative transitions is shown to be negligible; similar transitions to the conduction band are, however, important if the excited state is separated from the conduction band by not much more than 0$\cdot $1 eV. The temperature dependence of such transitions is complicated, but, for a wide range of temperatures, resembles e$^{-W/kT}$. Tentative estimates show that the result is consistent with the observed steep drop of the photo-conductive current with temperature.},

While analogous to multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, 2D optical spectroscopy differs significantly in its implementation. Yet, 2D Fourier spectroscopies still require point-by-point sampling of the time delay between two pulses responsible for creating quantum coherence among states. Unlike NMR, achieving the requisite phase stability at optical frequencies between these pulse pairs remains experimentally challenging. Nonetheless, 2D optical spectroscopy has been successfully demonstrated by combining passive and active phase stabilization along with precise control of optical delays and long-term temperature stability, although the widespread adoption of 2D ES has been significantly hampered by these technical challenges.

Abstract = {Coherence phenomena arise from interference, or the addition, of wave-like amplitudes with fixed phase differences. Although coherence has been shown to yield transformative ways for improving function, advances have been confined to pristine matter and coherence was considered fragile. However, recent evidence of coherence in chemical and biological systems suggests that the phenomena are robust and can survive in the face of disorder and noise. Here we survey the state of recent discoveries, present viewpoints that suggest that coherence can be used in complex chemical systems, and discuss the role of coherence as a design element in realizing function.},

abstract="We present a theoretical study of excitation dynamics in the chlorosome antenna complex of green photosynthetic bacteria based on a recently proposed model for the molecular assembly. Our model for the excitation energy transfer (EET) throughout the antenna combines a stochastic time propagation of the excitonic wave function with molecular dynamics simulations of the supramolecular structure and electronic structure calculations of the excited states. We characterized the optical properties of the chlorosome with absorption, circular dichroism and fluorescence polarization anisotropy decay spectra. The simulation results for the excitation dynamics reveal a detailed picture of the EET in the chlorosome. Coherent energy transfer is significant only for the first 50 fs after the initial excitation, and the wavelike motion of the exciton is completely damped at 100 fs. Characteristic time constants of incoherent energy transfer, subsequently, vary from 1 ps to several tens of ps. We assign the time scales of the EET to specific physical processes by comparing our results with the data obtained from time-resolved spectroscopy experiments.",

We are able to stabilize the 1 MHz atomic oscillation frequency to be better than 10 Hz or 10 ppm. This represents a suppression of ambient noise on the rf circuit by 34 dB. This technique could impact the sensitivity of ion trap mass spectrometry and the fidelity of quantum operations in ion trap quantum information applications.},

@article{Berkeland1998,
abstract = {Micromotion of ions in Paul traps has several adverse effects, including alterations of atomic transition line shapes, significant second-order Doppler shifts in high-accuracy studies, and limited confinement time in the absence of cooling. The ac electric field that causes the micromotion may also induce significant Stark shifts in atomic transitions. We describe three methods of detecting micromotion. The first relies on the change of the average ion position as the trap potentials are changed. The second monitors the amplitude of the sidebands of a narrow atomic transition, caused by the first-order Doppler shift due to the micromotion. The last technique detects the Doppler shift induced modulation of the fluorescence rate of a broad atomic transition. We discuss the detection sensitivity of each method to Doppler and Stark shifts, and show experimental results using the last technique.},

As much as possible, state manipulations are described in terms of quantum logic operations since the conditional dynamics implicit in quantum logic is central to the creation of entanglement. Keeping with current interest, some experimental issues in the proposal for trappedion quantum computation by J. I. Cirac and P. Zoller (University of Innsbruck) are discussed. Several possible decoherence mechanisms are examined and what may be the more important of these are identified. Some potential applications for entangled states of trapped-ions which lie outside the immediate realm of quantum computation are also discussed.},

@article{Shore1993,
abstract = {Abstract The Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), a soluble fully quantum mechanical model of an atom in a field, was first used (in 1963) to examine the classical aspects of spontaneous emission and to reveal the existence of Rabi oscillations in atomic excitation probabilities for fields with sharply defined energy (or photon number). For fields having a statistical distributions of photon numbers the oscillations collapse to an expected steady value. In 1980 it was discovered that with appropriate initial conditions (e.g. a near-classical field), the Rabi oscillations would eventually revive, only to collapse and revive repeatedly in a complicated pattern. The existence of these revivals, present in the analytic solutions of the JCM, provided direct evidence for discreteness of field excitation (photons) and hence for the truly quantum nature of radiation. Subsequent study revealed further non-classical properties of the JCM field, such as a tendency of the photons to antibunch. Within the last two years it ha...},
