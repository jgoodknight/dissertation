\chapter{Conclusion}
\dsp

The Work contained in this thesis hopefully makes it painfully clear that the Condon Approximation, must be tested against for all proposed protocols and it should be included in all molecular models going forward.  Molecules have non-trivial transition dipoles which can and do affect not just their electronic spectroscopy, but their electron-transfer rates~\cite{MavrosNonCondon} and their Raman Spectra~\cite{hellerGraphene}.  It's just a matter of time before more effects are found.
