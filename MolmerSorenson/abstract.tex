Molmer Sorenson gates have emerged as a promising architecture for Quantum computing in recent years.  Theoretical treatments of the architecture implicitly make the approximation that transitions between electronic states do not alter the nuclear state.  This approximation, sometimes called the Condon approximation, is very often valid but recent scholarship suggests that non-trivial transition dipole moments are important for physics in many different systems.  We investigate here the effect such a perturbation would have on a Molmer-Sorenson gate and estimate its effect.
